# Changelog

All notable changes to this crate will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this crate adheres to Rust's notion of
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html). Entries describe
the crate's public API and observable behavior from a consumer's perspective;
internal implementation details are not tracked here.

## [Unreleased]

## [3.0.0] - 2026-10-13

### Changed

- Raised the minimum supported Rust version from 1.91 to 1.97
  ([#567](https://github.com/zakura-core/common/pull/567)).

## [1.0.1] - 2026-08-29

### Changed

- Moved the repository from zakura-core/libraries to zakura-core/common;
  crate metadata and the packaged README now point at the new URL
  ([#266](https://github.com/zakura-core/common/pull/266)).

## [1.0.0] - 2026-08-28

### Changed

- Renamed the package from `halo2_legacy_pdqsort` to
  `zakura-halo2-legacy-pdqsort`; the library target keeps its original name, so
  existing `use` paths compile unchanged.
- Raised the minimum supported Rust version to 1.91 and migrated the crate to
  the 2024 edition.

## Record of Fork

`zakura-halo2-legacy-pdqsort` began as a fork of the `halo2_legacy_pdqsort`
crate and has been developed independently in this repository since. This
changelog starts at the fork point: history up to that point is documented in
the repository the code was forked from, and this crate's version lineage
restarted at `1.0.0` rather than continuing the original `0.1.0` numbering.
