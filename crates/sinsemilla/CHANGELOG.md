# Changelog

All notable changes to this crate will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this crate adheres to Rust's notion of
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html). Entries describe
the crate's public API and observable behavior from a consumer's perspective;
internal implementation details are not tracked here.

## [Unreleased]

## [3.0.0] - 2026-10-13

### Changed

- Raised the minimum supported Rust version from 1.91 to 1.97
  ([#567](https://github.com/zakura-core/common/pull/567)).

## [1.0.1] - 2026-08-29

### Changed

- Moved the repository from zakura-core/libraries to zakura-core/common;
  crate metadata and the packaged README now point at the new URL
  ([#266](https://github.com/zakura-core/common/pull/266)).

## [1.0.0] - 2026-08-28

### Added

- Added the `weighted` module: `weighted::UncheckedFixedLengthHashDomain<N>`
  precomputes a per-`HashDomain` table (its heap size is reported by
  `table_bytes`) and hashes messages of exactly `N` ten-bit words — `hash_words`
  and `hash_words_to_point` take pre-decoded words, while `hash` and
  `hash_to_point` take bit iterators — panicking on a wrong word count or an
  out-of-range word. Unlike `HashDomain`, it returns `pallas` values directly
  rather than `CtOption`, omitting the incomplete-addition failure cases; the
  module documentation gives the discrete-logarithm argument for why those cases
  are computationally infeasible to reach for independently generated domain
  constants.
- Added batch evaluation to `weighted::UncheckedFixedLengthHashDomain`:
  `hash_words_batch` hashes a slice of same-length messages together, and
  `hash_words_batch_with_workspace` does the same while reusing temporary
  allocations held in the new `weighted::BatchHashWorkspace` type.

### Changed

- Renamed the package from `sinsemilla` to `zakura-sinsemilla`; the library
  target keeps its original name, so existing `use` paths compile unchanged.
- Replaced the `pasta_curves` dependency with `zakura-pasta-curves` 1.0.0,
  whose types appear in this crate's API.
- Updated `group` from 0.13 to 0.14; the `pallas` point and field types this
  crate exposes now implement the `ff`/`group` 0.14 traits.
- Sped up `HashDomain::hash_to_point` and `HashDomain::hash`; results and
  exceptional-case failure behavior are unchanged.
- Raised the minimum supported Rust version to 1.91 and migrated the crate to
  the 2024 edition.

## Record of Fork

`zakura-sinsemilla` began as a fork of the `sinsemilla` crate and has been
developed independently in this repository since. This changelog starts at the
fork point: history up to that point is documented in the repository the code
was forked from, and this crate's version lineage restarted at `1.0.0` rather
than continuing the original `0.1.0` numbering.

- Forked from: `sinsemilla 0.1.0`, published from
  [zcash/sinsemilla](https://github.com/zcash/sinsemilla) at commit
  [`206f7a96`](https://github.com/zcash/sinsemilla/commit/206f7a960c55222a138a85447f1ddc666822cac0).
- Imported into this repository in commit `a57d014096a67071a2c6522a160c7e0dfbeff0f4`.
